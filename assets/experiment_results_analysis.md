## Analysis and Conclusions

### Method Characteristics:

1. **SoftSoup (Test0)**:
   - **Strengths**: Best overall performance, excellent balance between tasks, lowest QNLI forgetting
   - **Weaknesses**: Moderate SST2 forgetting compared to orthogonal methods
   - **Best for**: Scenarios requiring balanced performance across tasks

2. **Orthogonal Deltas (Test1)**:
   - **Strengths**: Exceptional SST2 retention (99.55%), minimal SST2 forgetting
   - **Weaknesses**: Highest QNLI forgetting, lowest overall fused performance
   - **Best for**: Scenarios where preserving the first task is critical

3. **Orthogonal + Normalization (Test1b)**:
   - **Strengths**: Good balance between methods, improved cross-task transfer, reduced QNLI forgetting vs. plain orthogonal
   - **Weaknesses**: Slightly lower performance than SoftSoup
   - **Best for**: Scenarios requiring a compromise between retention and performance

### Key Insights:

1. **Normalization Effect**: Adding normalization to orthogonal deltas (Test1b vs Test1) improves:
   - Cross-task transfer (SST2→QNLI: 0.450→0.502)
   - QNLI forgetting (0.174→0.158)
   - Overall fused performance (0.778→0.786)

2. **Trade-offs**: 
   - Orthogonal methods excel at preserving the first task but struggle with the second
   - SoftSoup provides the best overall balance
   - Normalization helps bridge this gap

3. **Practical Recommendation**: 
   - For **balanced continual learning**: Use **SoftSoup**
   - For **critical first task preservation**: Use **Orthogonal**
   - For **compromise solution**: Use **Orthogonal + Normalization**
