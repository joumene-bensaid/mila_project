# Weights & Biases

This directory contains W&B tracking data and artifacts.

## Structure
- Run directories with unique identifiers
- Experiment metadata and configurations
- Model checkpoints and artifacts
- Debug logs from W&B

## Usage
W&B data is automatically saved here when experiments are run with tracking enabled.
Each run gets a unique directory with format: `run-{timestamp}-{run_id}/`
